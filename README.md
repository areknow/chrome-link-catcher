chrome-link-catcher
===================

This extension can be loaded into chrome. It uses PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser (http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net) to parse a webpage and search for 'a' elements. The results are sent back to the extension and displayed in a quick dropdown list.

This requires 'Simple HTML DOM' and a server to host the php script.
